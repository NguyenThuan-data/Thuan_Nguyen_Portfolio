## Data Science Projects
 
### [Project 1: Car Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/NguyenThuan-data/School_Project_1_Car_Analysis-)
* This project involves a comprehensive exploration and analysis of a car dataset to understand the key factors that influence car pricing, fuel efficiency, and market segmentation.
* The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights derived from multivariate techniques.

### [Project 4: Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/NguyenThuan-data/School_Project_4_Bank_Analysis)
*	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on over 40,000 customer records, 17 attributes, performing data cleaning, transformation, and feature selection to enhance model performance
*	Authored a 2,500-word structured report, synthesizing findings, integrating data visualizations, and presenting insights in a clear, data-driven narrative
*	Explored artificial neural networks (ANNs), optimizing multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures through cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning
*	Developed predictive models for bank marketing campaign outcomes using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Na√Øve Bayes (NB), evaluating model performance with confusion matrices, and classification reports
### [Project 5: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/NguyenThuan-data/ds_salary_proj)
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Using dowloaded dataset that contain over 3000 job descriptions from **Kaggle** (can not scrape from Glassdoor)
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask
